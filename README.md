# EasyPubmedTextExtraction
General code to extract literature from PubMed and aggregating data from selected fields. 

The user can provide their custom keywords using a combination of "AND" or "OR" or "NOR" operators, and save the catergorized results in a tabular fashion (.CSV format) with custom name.

**Libraries used:**
1. easyPubMed (https://www.data-pulse.com/dev_site/easypubmed/)
2. kableExtra (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/index.html)
3. dplyr (https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/)

**Points to remember:**
1. Create a special directory for text mining results and change your working directory in Rstudio (Session->Set Working Directory -> Choose Directory)
2. Use AND/OR operators to modify your search.
3. Save each Excel by the name of your keywords.
